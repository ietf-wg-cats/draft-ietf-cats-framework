When such information is carried in a routing protocol, too many updates may affect network stability. This issue could be exploited by an attacker (e.g., by spawning and deleting service contact instances very rapidly). CATS solutions must support guards against such misbehaviors. For example, these solutions should support aggregation techniques, dampening mechanisms, and threshold-triggered distribution updates.\n\nThe information distributed by the C-SMAs and C-NMAs may be sensitive. Such information could indeed disclose intelligence about the network and the location of compute resources hosted in service sites. This information may be used by an attacker to identify weak spots in an operator's network. Furthermore, such information may be modified by an attacker resulting in disrupted service delivery for the clients, even including misdirection of traffic to an attacker's service implementation. CATS solutions must support authentication and integrity-protection mechanisms between C-SMAs/C-NMAs and C-PSes, and between C-PSes and Ingress CATS-Forwarders. Also, C-SMA agents need to support a mechanism to authenticate the services for which they provide information to C-PS computation logics, among other CATS functions.\n\nThe above text is the security consideration in CATS framework draft. it covers the intergrity-protection, the routes dampening mechanisms. Do you have any thoughts on the text? I may try to add more in these days, but would like to know your idea before doing that.",

A service request is processed according to the service logic (e.g., handle locally or solicit backend resources). Steering beyond the service contact instance is hidden to both clients and CATS components.[\u00b6](https://github.com/boucadair/CATS-framework/issues/new#section-2-2.32.1)\r\na service contact instance is reachable via at least one Egress CATS Forwarder.\r\nA service can be accessed via multiple service contact instances running at the same or different locations (service sites).\r\nThe same service contact instance may dispatch service requests to one or more service instances (e.g., ***an instance*** that behaves as a service load-balancer).\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I wonder what the\u00a0***an instance*** means here. Is it a\u00a0Service contact instance, or a\u00a0\u00a0service instance ?\r\n\r\nIMO, it is a\u00a0Service contact instance.\u00a0Thus, it can be changed to:\r\n\r\nThe same service contact instance may dispatch service requests to one or more service instances (e.g., ***a service contact instance*** that behaves as a service load-balancer).\r\n. \r\n\r\nIf\u00a0I\u00a0misunderstand it,\u00a0please\u00a0correct\u00a0me,\u00a0thanks.\r\n\r\nI also posted an email about the problem, and I hope to obtain some feedback here.",

The control plane and management plane can be implemented in a control center entity.\r\n\r\nIf the C-PS is logically centralized, it needs to communicate some policies to the CATS-Forwarders. In this case, the network entity containing the C-PS, such as a control center, should be able to perform management and/or control functions, including computing information awareness function, service scheduling function, etc. It collects computing and network information, and schedules service based on computing and network information. The CATS-Forwarders performs data plane functions or routing functions.\r\n\r\nIf the C-PS is collocated with an Ingress CATS-Forwarder, the functions that the Ingress CATS-Forwarder supports would include computing information awareness function, service scheduling function and data forwarding function. In this case, Ingress CATS-Forwarders make forwarding decisions for a given service request that has been received from a client according to the capabilities and status information of both service instances and network.\r\n\r\nIn either case, management plane policies need to be delivered to the CATS-Forwarders. For example, a general scheduling policy can be sent to the Ingress CATS-Forwarder, which would include policy execution node information, topology information and configuration information for real-time state collection of resources. If the C-PS is collocated with an Ingress CATS-Forwarder, the policy execution node would be the Ingress CATS-Forwarder. The topology information could be the nodes that need to be communicated to obtain the computing information. According to the topology information and configuration information in the received general scheduling policy, the Ingress CATS-Forwarder obtains the real-time status information of the computing resource, the service resource or the network resource. Based on these resource state information and the scheduling policy information in the general scheduling policy, the ingress CATS-Forwarder can obtain the target scheduling policy for the service requirement and schedule the corresponding service's traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nZongpeng Du\r\n",

However, in the Figure 3, we only see a direct line to the Ingress from the C-SMA.\n\nNew: Similarly, the C-SMA agent located at \"Service Site 3\" advertises the computing metrics for the two services hosted by \"Service Site 3\". *The advertisement may need to be relayed by the CATS-Forwarders 3.*\n\n2.Section 4.2. Metrics Distribution\n   Figure 4,  Figure 5,\nIn Figure4, about the CATS-Forwarders 1, two arrows point to it.\nIn Figure5, about the CATS-Forwarders 1, one arrow points to it.\nHowever, the Figure 4 is about the centralized model. I think there is no need of arrows. Two lines are enough. ",

      "body": "1.Section 6. Security Considerations\nOld: The computing resource information changes over time very frequently, especially with the creation and termination of service instances. When such information is carried in a routing protocol, too many updates may affect network stability. This issue could be exploited by an attacker (e.g., by spawning and deleting service contact instances very rapidly).\n\nNew: (e.g., by spawning and deleting service instances very rapidly).\n\nReason: It is stated that the service instance is created and terminated, and after that the attacker operates the service contact instances. Should we say the same thing here?\n\n2.Section 7. Privacy Considerations\n Old: In some cases, the service will need to know about applications, clients, and even user identity. This information is sensitive and should be encrypted. To prevent the information leaking between CATS components, the C-PS computed path information should be encrypted in distribution.\n\n I am not sure what the service means here. Does it mean the CATS service or the CATS system? Or it means the service instance? However, the service instance should know the information, and the information is a privacy in both CATS and non-CATS applications.  ",

Whether a CATS deployment follows a fully distributed design or relies upon a mix of centralized (e.g., a C-PS) and distributed CATS functions (e.g., CATS traffic classifiers) is deployment-specific and may reflect the savoir-faire of the (CATS) service provider. Centralized designs where the computing-related metrics from the C-SMAs are collected by a (logically) centralized path computation logic (like a Path Computation Element (PCE) {{?RFC4655}}) that also collects network metrics may, thus, be adopted. In the latter case, the (logically) centralized CATS computation logic may process incoming service requests to compute and select paths let alone service instances.

The Ingress CATS-Forwarder classifies the packets using the information provided by the CATS classifier (C-TC).

If a C-PS has selected a specific service contact instance and the C-TC has marked the traffic with the CIS-ID related information, the Egress CATS-Forwarder then forwards traffic to the relevant service contact instance accordingly. In some cases, the choice of the service contact instance may be left open to the Egress CATS-Forwarder (i.e., traffic is marked only with the CS-ID). In such cases, the Egress CATS-Forwarder selects a service contact instance using its knowledge of service and network capabilities as well as the current load as observed by the CATS-Forwarder, among other considerations.

      "body": "The preponderance of this merge requests consists of grammatical edits to improve clarity, conciseness and avoid passive voice (by stating the actor) where possible. \r\n\r\nHere are the changes that may warrant discussion on the mailing list: \r\n\r\n**1. Updated the client definition:**\r\n- OLD: An endpoint that is connected to a service provider network.\r\n- NEW: An endpoint that requests service from a service provider network.\r\n- DISCUSSION: A device connected to a network is a host, what makes it a client IMHO is the fact it enters into a client-server relationship by initiating a service request.\r\n\r\n**2. Update the flow definition:**\r\n- OLD: A flow is identified by the 5-tuple transport coordinates (source address and destination address, source and destination port numbers, and protocol).\r\n- NEW: \"A set of IP packets passing an Observation Point in the network during a certain time interval. All packets that belong to a particular Flow have a set of common properties derived from the data contained in the packet and from the packet treatment at the Observation Point.\" {{?RFC3954}}. Typically CATS components identify flows by the 5-tuple transport coordinates (source address and destination address, source and destination port numbers, and protocol).\r\n- DISCUSSION: I think the OLD version only identified a flow without defining it. If we want to not quote so much text we could simply state see RFC3954 but I think that gets annoying for new readers pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n**3. Update the metric definition:**\r\n- OLD: A piece of information that provides suitable input to a selection mechanism to determine a CATS egress node.\r\n-NEW: A quantitative measure that provides suitable input to a selection mechanism for CATS decision making.\r\n- DISCUSSION: More specific than piece of information -> \"quantitative measure\" see similar in [rfc8911:Registry for Performance Metrics](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8911/ ). Specifically, the terminology for \"Performance Metric\"\r\n\r\n**4. Update the service definition:**\r\n- OLD:  An offering that is made available by a service provider by orchestrating a set of resources (networking, compute, storage, etc.).\r\n-NEW: An interface a service provider exposes to a client to perform a function. Service providers establish services by orchestrating a set of resources (networking, compute, storage, etc.).\r\n- DISCUSSION: I referenced the service definition here to guide this definition update: [RFC8309](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8309#section-2). I think interface to provide a function remains general enough but is more specific than \"an offering\".\r\n\r\n**5. Update the service request definition:**\r\n- OLD:\r\n : A request to access or invoke a specific service. Such a request is steered to a service contact instance via CATS-Forwarders.\r\n : A service request is placed using service-specific protocols.\r\n : Service requests are not explicitly sent by clients to CATS-Forwarders.\r\n\r\n- NEW:\r\n : A request to access or invoke a specific service. CATS-Forwarders steer a service request to a service contact instance.\r\n : Clients must place a service request using service-specific protocols.\r\n : Clients direct service requests to a CS-ID without explicit knowledge of CATS-Forwarders.\r\n - DISCUSSION: I was not sure about what the original authors intended about the third bullet relating to \"explicitly sent\". I bring to the groups attention to ensure I did not change the original meaning in my edits.",

So this change narrows down the scope of devices considered a client from any connected device to only those requesting services that CATS devices must steer? Is this a bad assumption/logic?\r\n\r\nAlso, to me a host is a device that simply connects to a network as it is yet to enter into a client-server relationship? \r\n\r\nIf these thoughts don't make sense or are irrelevant, happy to just remove the passive voice, thoughts on:\r\n\"An endpoint that connects to a service provider network.\" ",
