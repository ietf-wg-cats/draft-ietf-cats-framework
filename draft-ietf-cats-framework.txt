1.  Introduction

   Computing service architectures evolved from a single service site to
   multiple, sometimes collaborative, service sites to address various
   issues such as long response times or suboptimal utilization of
   service and network resources (e.g., resource under-utilization or
   exhaustion).

   The underlying networking infrastructures that include computing
   resources usually provide relatively static service dispatching,
   e.g., the selection of the service instances for a request.  In such
   infrastructures, service-specific traffic is often directed to the
   closest service site from a routing perspective without considering
   the actual network state (e.g., traffic congestion conditions) or the
   service site state.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-cats-usecases-requirements], traffic
   steering that takes into account computing resource metrics would
   benefit several services, including latency-sensitive services such
   as immersive services that rely upon the use of augmented reality or
   virtual reality (AR/VR) techniques.  This document provides an
   architectural framework that aims at facilitating the making of
   compute- and network-aware traffic steering decisions in dynamic
   networking environments with variable computing service resources.

   Today, organizations often distribute user services across on-
   premises and cloud service provider networks.  To support both
   redundancy and responsiveness, the Computing-Aware Traffic Steering
   (CATS) framework supports single or multiple service instances
   providing one given service, which may exist in one or more service
   sites.  Clients access service instances via client-facing service
   functions known as service contact instances.  A single service site
   may host one or multiple service contact instances.  A single service
   site may have limited computing resources available at a given time,
   whereas the various service sites may experience different resource
   availability issues over time.  Therefore, steering traffic among
   different service sites can address resource limitations in a
   specific service site.

   Steering in CATS aims to select the appropriate service contact
   instance to service a request according to a set of network and
   computing metrics.  This selection may not reveal the actual service
   instance that a client will invoke, e.g., in hierarchical or
   recursive contexts.  Therefore, the metrics of the service contact
   instance may be aggregate metrics from multiple service instances.

   The CATS framework is an overlay framework for the selection of the
   suitable service contact instances from a set of candidates.  A
   combination of networking and computing metrics determine the exact
   characterization of services as 'suitable' or not.

   Furthermore, this document describes a workflow of the main CATS
   procedures (Section 4) executed in both the control and data planes.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Client:  An endpoint that connects to a service provider network.

   Flow:  A logical grouping of packets during a time interval,
      identified by some fields from the packet header, such as the
      5-tuple transport coordinates (source address and destination
      address, source and destination port numbers, and protocol).

   Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS):  A traffic engineering
      approach [RFC9522] that takes into account the dynamic nature of
      computing resources (e.g., compute and storage) and network state
      to optimize service-specific traffic forwarding towards a given
      service contact instance.  The CATS framework leverages various
      metrics to enable computing-aware traffic steering policies.

   Metric:  A quantitative measure that provides suitable input to a
      selection mechanism for CATS decision making.

   Computing metrics:  Metrics specific to the computing resources in
      the underlying CATS systems as distinct from other metrics, such
      as network metrics.  Examples of computing metrics are discussed
      in [I-D.ietf-cats-metric-definition].

   Service:  An offering that is made available by a service provider by
      orchestrating a set of resources (networking, compute, storage,
      etc.).

      The service provider retains control of internal resources and the
      service logic.  For example, these resources may be:

      *  Exposed by one or multiple processes.

      *  Provided by virtual instances, physical, or a combination
         thereof.

      *  Hosted within the same or distinct nodes.

      *  Hosted within the same or multiple service sites.

      *  Chained to provide a service using a variety of means.

      How a service provider structures its services remains out of the
      scope of CATS.

      Service providers may provide the same service in many locations;
      each of them constitutes a service instance.

   Computing Service:  A service offered to a client by a service
      provider by orchestrating a set of computing resources.

   CATS Service ID (CS-ID):  An identifier representing a service, which
      the clients use to access it.  See Section 3.2.

   Service instance:  A collection of running resources that are
      orchestrated following a service logic.  When invoked by a client
      request, these resources will collectively provide the intended
      service.

      A service provider may enable many service instances that adhere
      to the same service logic to provide the same service.

      A service instance runs in a service site and one or more
      instances may service clients' requests.

   Service site:  A location that hosts the resources that implement one
      or more service instances.

      A service site may be a node or a set of nodes.

   Service contact instance:  A client-facing function that is
      responsible for receiving requests in the context of a given
      service.

      A service contact instance can handle one or more service
      instances.

      Steering beyond a service contact instance is hidden to both
      clients and CATS components.

      A service contact instance processes a client's service request
      according to the service logic (e.g., handle locally or solicit
      backend resources).

      A service contact instance is reachable via at least one Egress
      CATS-Forwarder.

      Clients may access a service via multiple service contact
      instances running at the same or different locations (service
      sites).

      A service contact instance may dispatch service requests to one or
      more service instances (e.g., a service contact instance that
      behaves as a service load-balancer).

   CATS Service Contact Instance ID (CSCI-ID):  An identifier of a
      specific service contact instance.  See Section 3.2.

   Service request:  A request to access or invoke a specific service.
      CATS-Forwarders steer a service request to a service contact
      instance.

      Clients generate service requests using service-specific
      protocols.

      Clients send service requests to a service instance (identified by
      a CS-ID), without explicit knowledge of CATS-Forwarders.

   CATS-Forwarder:  A network entity that steers traffic specific to a
      service request towards a service contact instance according to
      forwarding decisions supplied by a CATS Path Selector (C-PS),
      which may or may not be part of a CATS-Forwarder.

      A CATS-Forwarder may behave as an Ingress or Egress CATS-
      Forwarder.  See Section 3.4.6.

   Ingress CATS-Forwarder:  An entity that steers service-specific
      traffic along a CATS-computed path that leads to an Egress CATS-
      Forwarder that connects to the most suitable service site that
      hosts the service contact instance selected to satisfy the initial
      service request.

   Egress CATS-Forwarder:  An entity located at the end of a CATS-
      computed path which connects to a service site.

   CATS Path Selector (C-PS):  A functional entity that selects paths
      towards service sites and instances (and thus service contact
      instances) in order to accommodate the requirements of service
      requests.  The path selection engine takes into account the
      service and network status information.  See Section 3.4.4.

   CATS Service Metric Agent (C-SMA):  A functional entity that is
      responsible for collecting service capabilities and status, and
      for reporting them to a C-PS.  See Section 3.4.2.

   CATS Network Metric Agent (C-NMA):  A functional entity that is
      responsible for collecting network capabilities and status, and
      for reporting them to a C-PS.  See Section 3.4.3.

   CATS Traffic Classifier (C-TC):  A functional entity that is
      responsible for determining which packets belong to a traffic flow
      for a specific service request.  It coordinates with the Ingress
      CATS-Forwarder so that such packets are placed onto a path
      computed by the C-PS that leads to the selected service contact
      instance.  See Section 3.4.5.

3.  CATS Framework and Components

3.1.  Assumptions

   CATS assumes that a service might be provided by one or multiple
   service instances.  Such instances may be hosted within the same or
   distinct service sites.  A given service is represented by the same
   service identifier (Section 3.2).  CATS does not make any additional
   assumption about these instances other than they are reachable via
   one or multiple service contact instances.

3.2.  CATS Identifiers

   CATS uses the following identifiers:

   CATS Service ID (CS-ID):  An identifier (ID) representing a service,
      which the clients use to access it.  Such an ID identifies all the
      instances of a given service, regardless of their locations.

      The CS-ID is independent of which service contact instance serves
      the service request.

      Service requests are spread over the service contact instances
      that can accommodate them, considering the location of the
      initiator of the service request and the availability (in terms of
      resource/traffic load, for example) of the service instances
      resource-wise among other considerations like traffic congestion
      conditions.

   CATS Service Contact Instance ID (CSCI-ID):  An identifier of a
      specific service contact instance.

      This document does not make any assumption about the structure and
      semantic of this identifier.  An example of such ID is a unicast
      IP address that uniquely identifies the location of a service
      instance.

3.3.  Framework Overview

   A high-level view of the CATS framework, without expanding the
   functional entities in the network, is illustrated in Figure 1.

                      Figure 1: Main CATS Interactions

   For the sake of illustration, "Service Instance" is shown as a single
   box in Figure 1.  However, this does not imply that a service
   instance is hosted in a single node.  Whether a service instance is
   realized by invoking resources within the same node or by chaining
   resources exposed by several nodes is deployment specific.

   The following planes are defined:

   *  CATS Management Plane: Responsible for monitoring, configuring,
      and maintaining CATS network devices.

   *  CATS Control Plane: Responsible for scheduling services based on
      computing and network information.  It is also responsible for
      making decisions about how packets should be forwarded by involved
      forwarding nodes and communicating such decisions to the CATS Data
      Plane for execution.

   *  CATS Data Plane: Responsible for computing-aware forwarding,
      including classifying packets, steering them onto chosen paths
      toward selected service contact instances, and forwarding the
      packets along the paths to the service contact instances.

   Depending on implementation and deployment, these planes may consist
   of several functional components, and the details will be described
   in the following sections.  For example, the control plane may
   consist of C-PS, C-NMA, etc.  The data plane may consist of CATS-
   Forwarders, C-TC, etc.

3.4.  CATS Functional Components

   CATS nodes make forwarding decisions for a given service request that
   has been received from a client according to the capabilities and
   status information of both service contact instances and network.
   The main CATS functional components and their interactions are shown
   in Figure 2.  These components are described in the subsections that
   follow.

3.4.1.  Service Sites, Service Instances, and Service Contact Instances

   Service sites are locations that host resources (including computing
   resources) that are required to offer a service.

   A compute service (e.g., for face recognition purposes or a game
   server) is identified by a CATS Service Identifier (CS-ID).  The CS-
   ID does not need to be globally unique, but must be sufficiently
   unique to unambiguously identify the service at all of the components
   of a CATS system.

   A single service can be represented and accessed via several contact
   instances that run in same or different regions of a network.

   As service instances are accessed via a service contact instance, a
   client will not see the service instances but only the service
   contact instance.

   Figure 2 shows two CATS nodes ("CATS-Forwarder 1" and "CATS-Forwarder
   3") that provide access to service contact instances.  These nodes
   behave as Egress CATS-Forwarders (Section 3.4.6).

      Note: "Egress" is used here in reference to the direction of the
      service request placement.  The directionality is called to
      explicitly identify the exit node of the CATS infrastructure.

3.4.2.  CATS Service Metric Agent (C-SMA)

   The CATS Service Metric Agent (C-SMA) is a functional component that
   gathers information about service sites and server resources, as well
   as the status of the different service instances.  A C-SMA may be co-
   located or located adjacent to a service contact instance, hosted by
   or adjacent to an Egress CATS-Forwarder (Section 3.4.6), etc.  There
   may be one or more C-SMAs in a deployment.

   Figure 2 shows one C-SMA embedded in "CATS-Forwarder 3" and another
   C-SMA that is adjacent to "CATS-Forwarder 1".

3.4.3.  CATS Network Metric Agent (C-NMA)

   The CATS Network Metric Agent (C-NMA) is a functional component that
   gathers information about the state of the underlay network.  The
   C-NMAs may be implemented as standalone components or may be hosted
   by other components, such as CATS-Forwarders or CATS Path Selectors
   (C-PSes) (Section 3.4.4).

   C-NMA is likely to leverage existing techniques (e.g., [RFC7471],
   [RFC8570], and [RFC8571]).

   Figure 2 shows a single, standalone C-NMA within the underlay
   network.  There may be one or more C-NMAs for an underlay network.

3.4.4.  CATS Path Selector (C-PS)

   The C-SMAs and C-NMAs share the collected information with C-PSes
   that use such information to select the Egress CATS-Forwarders (and
   potentially the service contact instances) where to forward traffic
   for a given service request.  C-PSes also determine the best paths
   (possibly using tunnels) to forward traffic, according to various
   criteria that include network state and traffic congestion
   conditions.  The collected information is encoded into one or more
   metrics that feed the C-PS path selection logic.  Such information
   also includes CS-ID and possibly CSCI-IDs.

   There might be one or more C-PSes used to select CATS paths in a CATS
   infrastructure.

   A C-PS can be integrated into CATS-Forwarders (e.g., "C-PS#1" in
   Figure 2) or may be deployed as a standalone component (e.g.,
   "C-PS#2" in Figure 2).  Generally, a standalone C-PS can be a
   functional component of a centralized controller (e.g., a Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655]).

   Refer to Section 4.2 for a discussion on metric distribution
   (including interaction with routing protocols).

3.4.5.  CATS Traffic Classifier (C-TC)

   The CATS Traffic Classifier (C-TC) is a functional component that is
   responsible for associating incoming packets from clients with
   service requests.  C-TCs also ensure that packets that are bound to a
   specific service contact instance are all forwarded towards that same
   service contact instance, as instructed by a C-PS.  To that aim, a
   C-TC uses CS-IDs (or their resolution of CS-ID to network locators)
   to classify service requests.  Refer to Section 5.1 for more details
   about provisioning of classification rules.

   Note that CS-IDs may be carried in packets if mechanisms such as TLS
   Server Name Indication extension (SNI) (Section 3 of [RFC6066]) are
   used.

   C-TCs are typically hosted in CATS-Forwarders.

3.4.6.  CATS-Forwarders

   Ingress CATS-Forwarders are responsible for steering service-specific
   traffic along a CATS-computed path that leads to an Egress CATS-
   Forwarder.  Egress CATS-Forwarders are the elements that behave as an
   egress for service requests that are forwarded over a CATS
   infrastructure.

   A service site that hosts service instances may be connected to one
   or more Egress CATS-Forwarders (e.g., multi-homing design).  If a
   C-PS has selected a specific service contact instance and the C-TC
   has marked the traffic with the CSCI-ID related information, the
   Egress CATS-Forwarder then forwards the traffic to the relevant
   service contact instance accordingly.

   In some cases, the choice of the service contact instance may be left
   open to the Egress CATS-Forwarder (i.e., traffic is marked only with
   the CS-ID).  In such cases, the Egress CATS-Forwarder selects a
   service contact instance using its knowledge of service and network
   capabilities as well as the current load as observed by the CATS-
   Forwarder, among other considerations.  In the absence of an explicit
   policy, an Egress CATS-Forwarder must make sure to forward all
   packets that pertain to a given service request towards the same
   service contact instance.

   Note that, depending on the design considerations and service
   requirements, per-service contact instance computing-related metrics
   or aggregated per-site computing related metrics (and a combination
   thereof) can be used by a C-PS.  Using aggregated per-site computing
   related metrics appears as a preferred option scalability-wise, but
   relies on Egress CATS-Forwarders that connect to various service
   contact instances to select the proper service contact instance.  An
   Egress CATS-Forwarder may choose to aggregate the metrics from
   different sites as well.  In this case, the Egress CATS-Forwarder
   will choose the best site by itself when the packets arrive at it.

3.4.7.  Underlay Infrastructure

   The "underlay infrastructure" in Figure 2 indicates an IP and/or MPLS
   network that is not necessarily CATS-aware.  The CATS paths that are
   computed by a C-PS will be distributed among the CATS-Forwarders
   (Section 3.4.6) and will not affect the underlay nodes.  Underlay
   nodes are typically P routers (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC4026]).

4.  CATS Framework Workflow

   The following subsections provide an overview of a typical CATS
   workflow.  In order to enable CATS in a given domain, some
   provisioning is needed; see more details in Section 5.1.  Section 5.2
   describes several deployment options (distributed, centralized, and
   hybrid models) to accommodate a variety of contexts.

4.1.  Service Announcement

   A service is associated by the service provider with a unique
   identifier called a CS-ID.  A CS-ID may be a network identifier, such
   as an IP address.  The mapping of CS-IDs to network identifiers may
   be learned through a name resolution service (e.g., DNS [RFC1034]).
   Note that CATS framework does not assume or preclude any specific
   name resolution service.

4.2.  Metrics Distribution

   As described in Section 3.4, a C-SMA collects both computing-related
   capabilities and metrics, and associates them with a CS-ID that
   identifies the service.  The C-SMA may aggregate the metrics for
   multiple service contact instances, maintain them separately, or
   both.

   The C-SMA then advertises CS-IDs along with metrics to related C-PSes
   in the network.  Depending on the deployment choice, CS-IDs with
   metrics may be distributed in different ways.  Refer to Section 5.3
   for more deployment considerations.

   The computing metrics include computing-related metrics and
   potentially other service-specific metrics like the number of clients
   that access the service contact instance at any given time, etc.

   Computing metrics may change very frequently (e.g., see Section 5.3
   of [I-D.ietf-cats-usecases-requirements] for a discussion).  How
   frequently such information is distributed is to be determined as
   part of the specification of any communication protocol (including
   routing protocols) that may be used to distribute the information.
   Various options can be considered, such as (but not limited to)
   interval-based updates, threshold-triggered updates, policy-based
   updates, or using normalized metrics.

   Additionally, the C-NMA collects network-related capabilities and
   metrics.  These may be collected and distributed by existing
   measurement protocols and/or routing protocols, although extensions
   to such protocols may be required to carry additional information
   (e.g., link latency).  The C-NMA distributes the network metrics to
   the C-PSes so that they can use the combination of service and
   network metrics to determine the best Egress CATS-Forwarder to
   provide access to a service contact instance and invoke the compute
   function required by a service request.  Similar to computing-related
   metrics, the network-related metrics can be distributed using
   distributed, centralized, or hybrid schemes.  This document does not
   describe such details since this is deployment-specific.

   Network metrics may also change over time.  Dynamic routing protocols
   may take advantage of some information or capabilities to prevent the
   network from being flooded with state change information (e.g.,
   Partial Route Computation (PRC) of OSPFv3 [RFC5340]).  C-NMAs should
   also be configured or instructed like C-SMAs to determine when and
   how often updates should be notified to the C-PSes.

4.3.  Service Access Processing

   A C-PS selects paths that lead to Egress CATS-Forwarders according to
   both service and network metrics that were advertised.  A C-PS may be
   collocated with an Ingress CATS-Forwarder (as shown in Figure 3) or
   logically centralized (in the centralized or hybrid models
   (Section 5.2)).

   This document does not specify any specific algorithm for path
   selection purposes to be supported by C-PSes in order to not
   constrain the CATS framework to one possible selection only.
   Instead, it is expected that a service request or local policy may
   feed the C-PS with appropriate information on that selection logic
   that takes the suitable metric information as input and the selected
   service contact instance as output.  Such appropriate information may
   be utilized to differentiate selection mechanisms to enable service-
   specific selections.

   In the example shown in Figure 3, the client sends a service request
   via the network through the "CATS-Forwarder 1", which is an Ingress
   CATS-Forwarder.  Note that, a service request to access the service
   may consist of one or more service packets (e.g., Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], HTTP [RFC9112], IPv6 [RFC8200], SRv6
   [RFC8754], or Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [RFC7826]) that
   carry the CS-ID and potential parameters.  When a matching
   classification entry maintained by a C-TC is found for the packets,
   the Ingress CATS-Forwarder encapsulates and forwards them to the C-PS
   selected Egress CATS-Forwarder.  When these packets reach the Egress
   CATS-Forwarder, the outer header of the possible overlay
   encapsulation will be removed and the inner packets will be sent to
   the relevant service contact instance.

4.4.  Service Contact Instance Affinity

   Service contact instance affinity means that packets that belong to a
   flow associated with a service request should always be sent to the
   same service contact instance.  Furthermore, packets of a given flow
   should be forwarded along the same path to avoid mis-ordering and to
   prevent the introduction of unpredictable latency variations.  A CATS
   framework implementation must ensure that service instance selection
   and path steering decisions remain consistent for a flow.
   Specifically, the same Egress CATS-Forwarder needs to be solicited to
   forward the packets.

   Ensuring service affinity for flows is a feature that can be
   configured on the C-PS when the service is deployed (i.e., all flows
   bound to a service) or determined at the time of newly formulated
   service requests (i.e., specific flow).

   Note that different services may have different notions of what
   constitutes a 'flow' and may, thus, identify a flow differently.
   Typically, a flow is identified by the 5-tuple transport coordinates
   (source address and destination address, source and destination port
   numbers, and protocol).  However, for instance, an RTP video stream
   may use different port numbers for video and audio channels: in that
   case, affinity may be identified as a combination of the two 5-tuple
   flow identifiers so that both flows are addressed to the same service
   contact instance.

   Hence, when specifying a protocol to communicate information about
   service contact instance affinity to C-TCs in particular, the
   protocol should support flexible mechanisms for identifying flows.
   Or, from a more general perspective, there should be a mechanism to
   specify and identify the set of packets that are subject to a service
   contact instance affinity.

   More importantly, the means for identifying a flow for ensuring
   instance affinity should be application-independent to avoid the need
   for service-specific instance affinity methods.  However, service
   contact instance affinity information may be configurable on a per-
   service basis.  For each service, the information can include the
   flow or packets identification type and means, affinity timeout
   value, etc.

   This document does not define any mechanism for defining or enforcing
   service contact instance affinity.

5.  Operational Considerations

5.1.  Provisioning of CATS Components

   Enabling CATS in a network can be done incrementally.  That is, not
   all ingress routers (Provider Edges (PEs), typically) need to be
   upgraded to support CATS.

   In addition to the CATS steering policies that are communicated by a
   C-PS to an Ingress CATS-Forwarder, some provisioning tasks are
   required.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   *  Provide C-PS elements with the locators of available Ingress CATS-
      Forwarder.  Such locators may also be discovered from the network.

   *  Supply information needed to connect C-PS elements with C-NMAs and
      C-SMAs.

   *  Allocate identifiers CS-ID/CSCI-ID and bind them to specific
      service contact instances.

   *  Provide C-PS elements with the set of optimization metrics (per
      service) and an optimization policy.

   *  Expose encapsulation capabilities supported by CATS-Forwarders.

   *  Configure specific encapsulation capabilities of CATS-Forwarders
      for use, including any credentials for mutual authentication
      between peer CATS-Forwarders.

   *  Expose classification capabilities of C-TC elements.

   *  Retrieve active classification table of C-TC elements.

   *  Reset the classification table of C-TC elements.

   *  Set the traffic counters at CATS-Forwarders to ease correlation
      between both Ingress and Egress CATS-Forwarders.  Such correlation
      is needed to help identify issues induced by the underlying
      encapsulation.

   *  Enable tools to check the correct behavior of various entities
      (e.g., classification rules, steering rules, and forwarding
      behavior)

   Provisioning includes configuration as well as distribution through
   protocols.  Specifically, the above tasks can be enabled using a
   variety of means (NETCONF [RFC6241], IPFIX [RFC7011], RESTCONF
   [RFC8040], YANG-Push [RFC8639], etc.).  It is out of scope to discuss
   required CATS extensions to these protocols.

5.2.  Deployment Considerations

   This document does not make any assumption about how the various CATS
   functional elements are implemented and deployed.  Concretely,
   whether a CATS deployment follows a fully distributed design or
   relies upon a mix of centralized (e.g., a centralized C-PS) and
   distributed CATS functions (e.g., C-TCs) is deployment-specific,
   which may reflect the preferences and policies of the (CATS) service
   provider.  The deployment can also be informed by specific use case
   requirements [I-D.ietf-cats-usecases-requirements].

   For example, in a centralized design, both the computing related
   metrics from the C-SMAs and the network metrics are collected by a
   (logically) centralized path computation logic (e.g., a PCE).  In
   this case, the CATS computation logic may process incoming service
   requests to compute paths to service contact instances.  More
   generally, the paths might be computed before a service request
   comes.  Based on the metrics and computed paths, the C-PS can select
   the most appropriate path and then synchronize with C-TCs.

   According to the method of distributing and collecting the computing
   metrics, three deployment models can be considered for the deployment
   of the CATS framework:

   *  *Distributed model*:  Computing metrics are distributed among
         network devices directly using distributed protocols without
         interactions with a centralized control element (e.g., network
         controller).  Service scheduling function is performed by the
         CATS-Forwarders in the distribution model, therefore, the C-PS
         is integrated into an Ingress CATS-Forwarder.

   *  *Centralized model*:  Computing metrics are collected by
         centralized control elements.  These elements then compute the
         forwarding path for service requests and syncs up with Ingress
         CATS-Forwarders.  In this model, C-PS is implemented in a
         centralized control element.

   *  *Hybrid model*:  Is a combination of distributed and centralized
         models.

         A part of computing metrics are distributed among involved
         network devices, and others may be collected by a centralized
         control element.  For example, some static information (e.g.,
         capabilities information) can be distributed among network
         devices since they are quite stable (i.e., change
         infrequently).  Frequent changing information (e.g., resource
         utilization) can be collected by a centralized control element
         to avoid frequent flooding in the distributed control plane.
         Service scheduling function can be performed by a centralized
         control element, Ingress CATS-Forwarders (co-located with a
         C-PS), or both depending on the specific deployment policies.

         When path computation is distributed, centralized control
         elements have to communicate the path information they collect
         to Ingress CATS-Forwarders (co-located with a C-PS) so that
         they take into account the full set of metrics for service
         scheduling.

   Examples to illustrate these models are provided in Appendix A.

   The framework covers only the case of a single service provider.
   Deployment considerations about the case of multiple service
   providers are out of scope.

5.3.  Implementation Considerations on Using CATS Metrics

   Advertising per-instance computing-related metrics instead of
   aggregating them into per-site advertisements has scalability
   implications on involved CATS elements.  Special care should be
   considered by providers when enabling per-instance metric
   distribution.

   Computing metrics need to be normalized (i.e., convert metric values
   with or without units into unitless scores), aggregated, or a
   combination thereof in order to soften the scalability impact while
   providing sufficient detail for effective CATS decision-making.  See,
   e.g., [I-D.ietf-cats-metric-definition] for a discussion on metrics
   and distribution approaches.

   Depending on the resources and processing capabilities of CATS
   components, the normalization and aggregation functions can be
   located in different CATS components.  An approach is to implement
   the normalization and aggregation functions located away from C-PSes,
   especially when C-PSes are co-located with CATS-Forwarders.  With
   this in mind, the normalization and aggregation functions of CATS
   metrics can be placed at service contact instances or C-SMAs.

   When C-SMAs are co-located with CATS-Forwarders where there is
   limited resource for processing, the placement of normalization
   functions in a C-SMA may bring too much overhead and may influence
   the routing efficiency.  Therefore, this document suggests to
   implement the normalization function at the service contact
   instances.  Regarding the aggregation functions, it can be
   implemented in a C-SMA or the service contact instances.

   In order to ensure consistent CATS decisions, the same normalization
   and aggregation functions must be enabled in all involved CATS
   components.  Also, in the case of service contact instances and
   C-SMAs are provided by different vendors, it is needed to use the
   same common normalization function and aggregation functions, so that
   the service contact instance selection result can be fair among all
   the service contact instances.  To that aim, a set of normalization
   and aggregation functions must standardized.  To accommodate contexts
   where multiple functions are supported, CATS implementations must
   expose a configuration parameter to control the activation of
   normalization and aggregation functions.

5.4.  Verifying Correct Operations

   A CATS implementation must log error events for better network
   management and operation.  Means to assess the reachability and trace
   CATS paths should be supported.

5.5.  Impact on Network Operations

   Computing metrics are collected and distributed in CATS.  A new
   function is needed to be deployed to manage the cooperation between
   network elements and computing elements.  For example, this function
   may be provided by an orchestrator connecting with C-SMA and C-NMA.
   This might bring more complexity of the network management,
   especially if this function is not leveraged for other purposes
   beyond CATS.

6.  Security Considerations

   The computing resource information changes over time very frequently,
   especially with the creation and termination of service instances.
   When such information is carried in a routing protocol, too many
   updates may affect network stability.  This issue could be exploited
   by an attacker (e.g., by spawning and deleting service instances very
   rapidly).  CATS solutions must support guards against such
   misbehaviors.  For example, these solutions should support
   aggregation techniques, dampening mechanisms, and threshold-triggered
   distribution updates.

   The information distributed by the C-SMAs and C-NMAs may be
   sensitive.  Such information could indeed disclose intelligence about
   the network and the location of compute resources hosted in service
   sites.  This information may be used by an attacker to identify weak
   spots in an operator's network.  Furthermore, such information may be
   modified by an attacker resulting in disrupted service delivery for
   the clients, even including misdirection of traffic to an attacker's
   service implementation.  CATS solutions must support authentication
   and integrity-protection mechanisms between C-SMAs/C-NMAs and C-PSes,
   and between C-PSes and Ingress CATS-Forwarders.  Also, C-SMAs need to
   support a mechanism to authenticate the services for which they
   provide information to C-PS computation logics, among other CATS
   functions.

   This document focuses on the scenario of a single service provider.
   Hence, security considerations relevant to deployment with multiple
   service providers are out of scope.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   CATS solutions must support preventing on-path nodes in the underlay
   infrastructure to fingerprint and track clients (e.g., determining
   which client accesses which service).  More generally, personal data
   must not be exposed to external parties by CATS beyond what is
   carried in the packet that was originally issued by the client.

   In some cases, the CATS solution may need to know about applications,
   clients, and even user identity.  This information is sensitive and
   should be encrypted.  To prevent the information leaking between CATS
   components, the C-PS computed path information should be encrypted in
   distribution.  The specific encryption method may be applied at the
   network layer, transport layer, or at the application/protocol level
   depending on the implementation, so this is out of the scope of this
   document.

   This document focuses on the scenario of a single service provider.
   Hence, privacy considerations relevant to deployment with multiple
   service providers are out of scope.

   For more discussion about privacy, refer to [RFC6462] and [RFC6973].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request for IANA action.

Appendix A.  Deployment Examples

   This section provides examples to illustrate examples of CATS metrics
   distribution.  These examples are not deployment recommendations.

   The following example mainly describes a per-instance computing-
   related metric distribution for illustration purposes.  Such
   information may be aggregated into a single advertisement.

A.1.  Distributed Model

   Figure 3 shows an example of how CATS metrics can be disseminated in
   the distributed model.

   There is a client attached to the network via "CATS-Forwarder 1".
   There are three service contact instances of the service with CS-ID
   "1": two service contact instances with CSCI-IDs "1" and "2",
   respectively, are located at "Service Site 2" attached via "CATS-
   Forwarder 2"; the third service contact instance is located at
   "Service Site 3" attached via "CATS-Forwarder 3" and with CSCI-ID
   "3".  There is also a second service with CS-ID "2" with only one
   service contact instance located at "Service Site 3".

   The C-SMA collocated with "CATS-Forwarder 2" distributes the
   computing metrics for both service contact instances (i.e., (CS-ID 1,
   CSCI-ID 1) and (CS-ID 1, CSCI-ID 2)).  Similarly, the C-SMA located
   at "Service Site 3" advertises the computing metrics for the two
   services hosted by "Service Site 3".  The C-SMA may distribute the
   computing metrics to the Egress "CATS-Forwarder 3".  Then, the
   computing metrics can be redistributed by the Egress CATS-Forwarder
   to the Ingress CATS-Forwarder.  The C-SMA also may directly
   distribute the computing metrics to the Ingress CATS-Forwarder.

   The computing metrics advertisements are processed by the C-PS hosted
   by "CATS-Forwarder 1".  The C-PS also processes network metric
   advertisements sent by the C-NMA.  All metrics are used by the C-PS
   to select the most relevant path that leads to the Egress CATS-
   Forwarder according to the initial client's service request, the
   service that is requested ("CS-ID 1" or "CS-ID 2"), the state of the
   service contact instances as reported by the metrics, and the state
   of the network.

   In the case of distributing aggregated per-site computing-related
   metrics, the per-instance CSCI-ID information will not be included in
   the advertisement.  Instead, a per-site CSCI-ID may be used in case
   multiple sites are connected to the Egress CATS-Forwarder to
   explicitly indicate the site from where the aggregated metrics come.

                          Distributed Model

A.2.  Centralized Model

   An example of metrics distribution in the centralized model is
   illustrated in Figure 4.

   The C-SMA collocated with "CATS-Forwarder 2" distributes the
   computing metrics for both service contact instances (i.e., (CS-ID 1,
   CSCI-ID 1) and (CS-ID 1, CSCI-ID 2)) to the centralized C-PS.  In
   this case, the C-PS is a logically centralized element deployed
   separately with the "CATS-Forwarder 1".  Similarly, the C-SMA located
   at "Service Site 3" advertises the computing metrics for the two
   services hosted by "Service Site 3" to the centralized C-PS as well.
   Furthermore, the C-PS receives the network metrics sent from the
   C-NMA.  All metrics are used by the C-PS to select the most relevant
   path that leads to the Egress CATS-Forwarder.  The selected paths
   will be sent from the C-PS to "CATS-Forwarder 1" to indicate traffic
   steering.

                 Service CS-ID 1, instance CSCI-ID 2 <computing metrics>

A.3.  Hybrid Model

   An example of metrics distribution in the hybrid model is illustrated
   in Figure 5.

   For example, the metrics 1, 2, and 3 associated with the "CS-ID1" are
   collected by the centralized C-PS, and the metrics 4 and 5 are
   distributed via distributed protocols to the Ingress CATS-Forwarder
   directly.  For a service with "CS-ID2", all the metrics are collected
   by the centralized C-PS.  The CATS-computed path result will be
   distributed to the Ingress CATS-Forwarders from the C-PS by
   considering both the metrics from the C-SMA and C-NMA.  Furthermore,
   the Ingress CATS-Forwarder may also have some ability to compute the
   path for subsequent packets accessing the same service.
